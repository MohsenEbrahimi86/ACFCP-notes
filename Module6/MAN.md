A **Metropolitan Area Network (MAN)** is a type of computer network that spans a city or a large campus, covering a geographical area larger than a **Local Area Network (LAN)** but smaller than a **Wide Area Network (WAN)**. Typically, a MAN connects multiple LANs within a metropolitan region, such as a city or a large university campus.

### Key Features of a MAN:

- **Geographic Scope:** Usually ranges from a few kilometers up to about 50–100 km in diameter — roughly the size of a city.
- **High Speed:** Offers high data transfer rates, often using fiber-optic cables or high-speed wireless technologies.
- **Connectivity:** Connects multiple LANs, enabling communication between different offices, buildings, or institutions across a city.
- **Ownership:** May be operated by a single organization (e.g., a city government or university) or a service provider (e.g., an ISP).

### Common Uses of MANs:

- Connecting branch offices of a company within a city.
- Providing city-wide internet access or municipal services (e.g., traffic control, public Wi-Fi).
- Supporting educational institutions or research networks across a metropolitan area.
- Used by Internet Service Providers (ISPs) to deliver broadband services.

### Technologies Used in MANs:

- **Fiber Distributed Data Interface (FDDI)**
- **Ethernet (especially Gigabit and 10-Gigabit Ethernet)**
- **Synchronous Optical Networking (SONET)**
- **WiMAX (Wireless MAN - IEEE 802.16)**
- **LTE/5G** for wireless MANs

### Example:

A university with multiple campuses across a city might use a MAN to link its networks, allowing seamless access to resources, email, and databases across all locations.

### Comparison:

| Network Type | Coverage                  | Example                                           |
| ------------ | ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **LAN**      | Single building or campus | Office network                                    |
| **MAN**      | City-wide                 | City-wide university or ISP network               |
| **WAN**      | Country or global         | The Internet, corporate networks across countries |

In summary, a **Metropolitan Area Network (MAN)** is a crucial middle layer in network infrastructure, bridging the gap between local and wide-area networks in urban environments.
