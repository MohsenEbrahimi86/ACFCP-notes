**EGP Routing** stands for **Exterior Gateway Protocol Routing**, which refers to the category of routing protocols used to exchange routing information **between different Autonomous Systems (AS)** on the internet.

An **Autonomous System (AS)** is a collection of IP networks and routers under the control of a single organization that presents a common routing policy to the internet (e.g., an ISP, a large enterprise, or a university).

---

### Purpose of EGP Routing:

- To enable **inter-domain routing** — that is, routing between different networks or organizations.
- To determine the best path for traffic to travel across the **global internet**, not just within a single network.
- To ensure scalability and policy-based routing across large networks.

---

### Key Characteristics of EGP Routing:

- Operates between **different AS numbers**.
- Focuses on **policy, scalability, and stability** rather than just shortest path.
- Uses **path-vector** or **distance-vector** mechanisms to make routing decisions.
- Designed to handle the massive scale of the internet.

### Modern Example: BGP

The most widely used and only practical **EGP** today is:

### **BGP (Border Gateway Protocol)**

- Specifically, **eBGP (external BGP)** is used between different autonomous systems.
- BGP makes routing decisions based on paths, network policies, and rule sets configured by network administrators.
- It is the protocol that makes the **internet work** by connecting different ISPs and organizations.

> ⚠️ Note: The original protocol named **EGP** (defined in RFC 904) existed in the early days of the internet but is now obsolete. Today, "EGP" generally refers to the **class of protocols** used for inter-AS routing, with **BGP** being the dominant one.

### EGP vs IGP

| Feature     | **EGP (Exterior Gateway Protocol)** | **IGP (Interior Gateway Protocol)**            |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Purpose     | Routing between autonomous systems  | Routing within a single AS                     |
| Examples    | BGP (eBGP)                          | OSPF, RIP, EIGRP, IS-IS                        |
| Scope       | Inter-domain                        | Intra-domain                                   |
| Metrics     | Policy-based, path attributes       | Hop count, bandwidth, delay                    |
| Convergence | Slower (due to stability focus)     | Faster                                         |
| Use Case    | Internet backbone, ISP peering      | Enterprise or organizational internal networks |

### Example:

When you access a website hosted in another country, your request likely passes through multiple ISPs. **BGP (an EGP)** is used to determine how your data moves from your ISP’s AS to the destination AS where the website resides.

---

### Summary:

**EGP Routing** is the process of routing data **between different autonomous systems** using exterior gateway protocols. While the original EGP protocol is obsolete, the term lives on to describe protocols like **BGP**, which are essential for global internet connectivity and inter-domain routing.
