A **Network Interface Card (NIC)**, also known as a **network adapter** or **network interface controller**, is a hardware component that allows a computer or other device to connect to a network — whether wired or wireless.

It serves as the **physical interface** between the device (like a desktop, laptop, or server) and the network medium (such as Ethernet cable or Wi-Fi signal), enabling data transmission and reception over a network.

### Key Functions of a NIC:

1. **Connects to a Network:** Enables a device to join a Local Area Network (LAN), Wide Area Network (WAN), or the Internet.
2. **Data Transmission & Reception:** Converts data from the computer into network-ready signals (and vice versa).
3. **Implements Network Protocols:** Supports communication standards like Ethernet (for wired) or Wi-Fi (for wireless).
4. **Has a Unique MAC Address:** Every NIC comes with a globally unique **Media Access Control (MAC) address**, used to identify the device on a local network.

### Types of NICs:

| Type             | Description                                              | Example Use                                       |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **Wired NIC**    | Connects via Ethernet cable (RJ-45 port)                 | Desktops, servers                                 |
| **Wireless NIC** | Connects via Wi-Fi (IEEE 802.11 standards)               | Laptops, smartphones                              |
| **Combo NIC**    | Supports both wired and wireless connections             | Modern laptops                                    |
| **USB NIC**      | External adapter plugged into a USB port                 | Adding network capability to older devices        |
| **PCI/PCIe NIC** | Internal card installed in a computer’s motherboard slot | Desktops requiring high-speed or additional ports |

### Where Is a NIC Located?

- In **desktops and laptops**, the NIC is usually built into the motherboard (integrated).
- It can also be added as an expansion card (PCI, PCIe) or via USB.
- In **smartphones and tablets**, the wireless NIC is embedded in the system-on-a-chip (SoC).

---

### Key Features:

- **Speed:** Common speeds include 10/100 Mbps (Fast Ethernet), 1 Gbps (Gigabit Ethernet), and 10 Gbps (for high-end servers).
- **Duplex Mode:** Supports half-duplex (send or receive) or full-duplex (send and receive simultaneously).
- **Driver Support:** Requires software drivers to communicate with the operating system.

---

### Example:

When you connect your laptop to the internet using Wi-Fi or plug in an Ethernet cable, you're using the **NIC** to send requests (like loading a webpage) and receive data from the network.

---

### Importance of a NIC:

- Essential for **any network communication**.
- Enables **internet access**, file sharing, printing over a network, video conferencing, and cloud services.
- Critical in servers, routers, and IoT devices.

---

### Summary:

A **Network Interface Card (NIC)** is a vital hardware component that enables a device to connect and communicate over a network. Whether wired or wireless, every networked device — from your phone to a data center server — relies on a NIC to access the digital world.
