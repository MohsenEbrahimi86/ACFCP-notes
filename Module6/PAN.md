A **Personal Area Network (PAN)** is a small-scale network that connects devices around an individual's immediate workspace, typically within a range of a few meters (up to about 10 meters). It is designed to enable communication between personal devices or to connect personal devices to a larger network (like the internet).

---

### Purpose of a PAN:

To allow a person to easily transfer data, synchronize, or share resources between their personal electronic devices — such as smartphones, laptops, tablets, smartwatches, headphones, and printers.

---

### Types of PANs:

1. **Wired PAN:**  
   Uses physical cables like USB to connect devices (e.g., connecting a smartphone to a computer via USB).

2. **Wireless PAN (WPAN):**  
   Uses wireless technologies such as:
   - **Bluetooth** (most common — e.g., connecting wireless earbuds to a phone)
   - **Wi-Fi Direct** (for high-speed file sharing between devices)
   - **Infrared (IrDA)** (older technology, line-of-sight only)
   - **Zigbee** or **NFC (Near Field Communication)** (for smart home devices or contactless payments)

---

### Examples of PANs:

- Connecting a wireless headset to a smartphone via Bluetooth.
- Syncing a smartwatch with a phone.
- Transferring photos from a digital camera to a laptop using Wi-Fi Direct.
- Using NFC to make a mobile payment with a smartphone.
- Tethering a laptop to a phone’s internet via Bluetooth or USB.

---

### Key Features:

- **Short Range:** Usually up to 10 meters.
- **Low Power Consumption:** Especially important for wearable and mobile devices.
- **Easy Setup:** Often automatic or requires minimal configuration.
- **Personal Use:** Focused on one user’s devices.

---

### Advantages:

- Convenient for device connectivity and data sharing.
- Supports mobility and wireless freedom.
- Low cost and energy-efficient (especially Bluetooth).
- Enables automation (e.g., smart home devices via PAN).

---

### Disadvantages:

- Limited range.
- Potential security risks (e.g., Bluetooth hacking or unauthorized access).
- Slower speeds compared to Wi-Fi or wired networks (depending on the technology).

### Comparison with Other Networks:

| Network Type | Coverage        | Example                              |
| ------------ | --------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| **PAN**      | 0–10 meters     | Bluetooth earbuds connected to phone |
| **LAN**      | Single building | Office network                       |
| **CAN**      | Campus          | University network                   |
| **MAN**      | City-wide       | ISP city network                     |
| **WAN**      | Global          | The Internet                         |

### Summary:

A **Personal Area Network (PAN)** is the smallest type of network, centered around an individual and their personal devices. It plays a crucial role in modern digital life by enabling seamless, wireless connectivity between smartphones, wearables, computers, and accessories — making everyday tasks like calling, listening to music, or syncing data simple and efficient.
