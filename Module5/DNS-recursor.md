A **Recursive Resolver** (also known as a **recursive DNS resolver**) is a type of Domain Name System (DNS) server that is responsible for resolving domain names into IP addresses on behalf of client devices (like your computer or smartphone). It performs the entire process of looking up a domain name by querying multiple DNS servers if necessary until it finds the correct IP address.

### How It Works:

When you type a website (e.g., `www.example.com`) into your browser, your device contacts a recursive resolver to find the corresponding IP address. The resolver then:

1. **Checks its cache** – If it has recently resolved the same domain, it returns the cached result.
2. **Queries DNS hierarchy if needed**:
   - Contacts the **root DNS servers** to find the appropriate **Top-Level Domain (TLD)** server (e.g., `.com`).
   - Then queries the **TLD server** to find the **authoritative name server** for `example.com`.
   - Finally, queries the **authoritative name server** to get the IP address for `www.example.com`.
3. **Returns the result** to your device and caches it for future use.

### Key Features:

- **Recursive**: It performs the full lookup process on behalf of the client.
- **Caching**: Stores recent DNS responses to speed up future queries.
- **Client-facing**: Typically provided by ISPs, public DNS services (like Google DNS `8.8.8.8`, Cloudflare `1.1.1.1`), or enterprise networks.

### Example:

If you use Google's public DNS (`8.8.8.8`), that server acts as a recursive resolver. It handles your DNS query from start to finish and returns the IP address.

### Contrast with Other DNS Servers:

- **Authoritative DNS Server**: Holds the actual DNS records for a domain and provides definitive answers.
- **Recursive Resolver**: Doesn’t hold records permanently; it fetches them from authoritative servers when needed.

### Summary:

A **recursive resolver** is like a librarian who searches through multiple books (DNS servers) to find the information (IP address) you requested. It simplifies the DNS lookup process for end users by handling the complexity behind the scenes.
