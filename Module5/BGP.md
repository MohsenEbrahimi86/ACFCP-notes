**BGP (Border Gateway Protocol)** is the **routing protocol that powers the internet**. It‚Äôs responsible for determining how data packets travel from one network to another across the globe.

Think of BGP as the **"GPS for the internet"** ‚Äî it helps routers figure out the best path to send traffic between different networks, especially across large distances and multiple providers.

### üåê What Does BGP Do?

BGP is a **path vector protocol** used to exchange routing information between **autonomous systems (AS)**.

- An **Autonomous System (AS)** is a large network or group of networks under a single administrative control.
  - Example: AT&T (AS7018), Google (AS15169), Cloudflare (AS13335)

BGP tells each AS:

> "I can reach these IP addresses, and here‚Äôs the path to get there."

---

### üîó How BGP Works (Simplified)

1. **Each AS runs BGP routers** that connect to routers in other ASes (called **peers**).
2. They **exchange routing announcements**:
   - "I can reach IP range 203.0.113.0/24 via me."
3. Based on policies, rules, and path attributes, each AS chooses the **best route** to forward traffic.
4. These decisions propagate across the internet.

> ‚úÖ BGP doesn‚Äôt care about speed ‚Äî it cares about **reachability** and **policy**.

### üß≠ Key Concepts

| Term                                      | Meaning                                                                            |
| ----------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Autonomous System (AS)**                | A network controlled by one organization (e.g., ISP, cloud provider)               |
| **AS Number (ASN)**                       | Unique ID for an AS (e.g., AS15169 = Google)                                       |
| **BGP Session**                           | A connection between two BGP peers (routers in different ASes)                     |
| **Route Announcement (or Advertisement)** | When an AS says, ‚ÄúI can reach these IPs‚Äù                                           |
| **Path Attributes**                       | Data like AS_PATH (list of ASes the route passes through), which helps avoid loops |

### üåç Real-World Example

You‚Äôre in New York and want to visit `www.tokyo-server.com` (in Japan).

- Your request doesn‚Äôt go directly.
- Your ISP uses BGP to ask: _"Who knows how to reach Tokyo‚Äôs network?"_
- Multiple paths may exist:
  - Through London ‚Üí Singapore ‚Üí Tokyo
  - Through Los Angeles ‚Üí Tokyo
- Based on BGP rules (cost, policy, reliability), a path is chosen.

BGP dynamically adapts if a link fails ‚Äî it finds a new route!

### ‚ö†Ô∏è BGP Risks & Vulnerabilities

Despite being critical, BGP has **no built-in security**:

| Risk                                                                                                                                           | Description                                                                         |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **BGP Hijacking**                                                                                                                              | A malicious AS falsely announces it owns someone else‚Äôs IP range, diverting traffic |
| **Route Leaks**                                                                                                                                | Misconfigured BGP announces routes to unintended peers, causing outages             |
| **Example**: In 2008, Pakistan tried to block YouTube but accidentally announced it owned YouTube‚Äôs IPs ‚Äî and traffic was redirected globally! |

> üîê This is why **RPKI (Resource Public Key Infrastructure)** is now used to cryptographically validate BGP routes.

### ‚úÖ Why BGP Matters to You

Even if you're not running a network:

- **Cloud services** (AWS, Cloudflare, etc.) use BGP to route your app‚Äôs traffic.
- **DDoS protection** often involves BGP ‚Äî e.g., Cloudflare can "blackhole" bad traffic via BGP.
- **Site reliability** depends on correct BGP configuration.

### üß© Fun Fact

> The internet has **over 100,000+ BGP routes**. All major networks rely on BGP to stay connected.
