**DAS (Direct Attached Storage)** refers to a digital storage system that is directly connected to a computer or server, rather than being accessible over a network. It is one of the simplest and most common forms of data storage.

### Key Characteristics of DAS:

- **Direct Connection**: DAS is connected directly to the host computer using interfaces such as:
  - SATA (Serial ATA)
  - SAS (Serial Attached SCSI)
  - USB (Universal Serial Bus)
  - NVMe (over PCIe)
- **No Network Required**: Unlike NAS (Network Attached Storage) or SAN (Storage Area Network), DAS does not rely on a network for data access.
- **High Performance**: Because itâ€™s directly attached, DAS typically offers low latency and high data transfer speeds.
- **Simplicity**: Easy to set up and manage, especially in small environments.
- **Limited Sharing**: Data on DAS is usually only accessible to the host machine it's attached to, unless shared via other software or network services.

### Common Examples of DAS:

- Internal hard drives or SSDs inside a desktop or server.
- External hard drives connected via USB or Thunderbolt.
- JBOD (Just a Bunch of Disks) enclosures connected directly to a server.

### Use Cases:

- Personal computers and workstations needing fast local storage.
- Servers that require high-performance, low-latency storage.
- Environments where network-based storage is unnecessary or too costly.

### Advantages:

- Fast data access due to direct connection.
- Lower cost compared to networked storage solutions.
- Simpler configuration and maintenance.

### Disadvantages:

- Limited scalability and flexibility.
- Difficult to share data across multiple systems.
- No centralized storage management in multi-server environments.

### Summary:

DAS is ideal for applications that demand high-speed, reliable storage with minimal complexity. However, for environments requiring data sharing, redundancy, or centralized management across multiple devices, networked storage solutions like NAS or SAN are typically preferred.
